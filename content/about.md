I’m a graduate student from University of Pittsburgh, where I got my Master’s Degree in Information Science. With an interest in Data Science, I devoted my last two years to learn the basics, and hope to find a related job. But after a long time job searching, I failed.

Without a solid quantitative background, it is relatively hard for me to fully understand some concepts and advanced topics. I tried to make this up by taking some Probability and Statistics courses, but not very successful. Recruiters seem know my situation, so my applications got rare feedbacks, let alone interviews.

Now I shift my gear to programming, which I am also interested and did better. Even though, I found myself still staying on the surface, just like I learnt those math stuffs. I decide to change that by building my blog to replace my portfolio site. I think what I know is more important than what I did. I will not stop practicing, instead I will open my mind, read more, practice more and share more. Because I believe:
