•	Areas Between Curves
▪	Integrand: f(x) - g(x)
▪	Limits of integration: a and b
▪	Draw the picture first!
▪	Set up integral
▪	Solve by segment
▪	Change axis
•	Volumes
◦	Method of Disks (Slicing)
▪	Height of arc is y
▪	Area of slice is 𝜋y2
▪	Example
▪	Volume of a Sphere
◦	Method of Shells
▪	Volume of a Cauldron
▪	, y = x2
▪	Thickness: dx
▪	Hight: a - y
▪	Circumference: 2𝜋x
▪	Limit: 0, a^1/2
▪	Warning about units
▪	a = 100cm vs. a = 1m give different result
▪	The result is not scalable
